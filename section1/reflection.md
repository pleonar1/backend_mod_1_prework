## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
- One thing that immediately stood out to me was that super learners read a lot.  I have been reading most of my life constantly whether its novels or if I am just reading articles on reddit.  Reading about how I may already be using superlearner techniques made me feel pretty good.  I think that this will help me with coding because I don't really have a problem spending hours or more reading on a subject.
1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.  
Interpolation is when you insert a variable to be expressed in the string.

"one animal that is white and black is a #{animal}."

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
gets.chomp

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
You can use the length method to find out how long a string is
you can use the split method to only express part of the string.
