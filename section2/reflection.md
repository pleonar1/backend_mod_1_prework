## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

### If Statements

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
- A conditional statement essentially setting conditions to be met in order to produce a result.
- example 1: "If we have all of our gear packed and the car is filled up with gas, we can now go camping."
- example 2: "If our phone battery is not charged (false) then we cannot make a phone call"
- example "If we have eggs, if we have flour, if we have sugar, if we have icing, then we can make a cake."

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
- You can use an if statement to set parameters for your code to do certain things in certain circumstances.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
"if"  (condition)
  puts "outcome
"end"
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
- You can set a condition and then use "&&" and then set another condition.

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
"if" (condition)
  puts (outcome)
"elsif" (condition)
  puts (different outcome)
else (edge case)
  puts (edge case outcome)
end
1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
I have looked up a few things about "unless" statements that seem to differ slightly from if statements but it is still a conditional statement.
### Methods

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
