## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- So, I read the dual blog posts and what really resonated with me was how they wanted to make sure we realized that you can improve your skills with effort and practice.  This rang true for me because the only reason I am even understanding this stuff at the point I am at now is by making sure I get the keystrokes.  I can't explain how much this mod one pre work is helping me to understand the concepts we learned in class.
- Another thing that resonated with me well was how mistakes are critical to learning.  Doing this prework has been eye opening in the sense that I was always considered "gifted" (eye roll) growing up and I never made many mistakes in school.  I am making mistake left and right while learning this stuff and honestly thats the only way I think I will be able to learn  lot of this stuff.  When there is something I don't understand, I play around in repl and make ungodly mistakes until I finally get it and it has been a great feeling every time I do.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- As I said in the first response^, I think I am growing accustomed to learning from my mistakes and accepting the challenge.  That mindset has really helped me power through a lot of this stuff!
- I would say a place where I am lacking is with reflection.  When I close this laptop I really close it.  I don't think about coding at all until I open it again.  I would like to spend at least 20 minutes a day reflecting on what I was doing while I was coding in any given day before I go to bed.  I will try to make time for it every night in mod 1.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
- A Hash is a way that we can store data using unique key terms.  It is different from an array because you can only call upon pieces of an array using numbers.  With a hash, you can define data into a key of almost anything.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
- pet_store = {
-  puppies: 25,
-  kitties: 39,
-  dog_food: 100,
-  cat_food: 130,
-  fish: 58,
-  fish_food: 78
- }

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
- puts "#{states["IA"]}"
1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
- For keys: states.keys
- For values: states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
- We can use a hash to store data for future use and once you learn how to use them well then you can use them like a dictionary for values that you might not want to keep typing over and over again when working on long pieces of code.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
- I would like to learn more about the syntax when using symbols instead of strings to create and call values from hashes.
