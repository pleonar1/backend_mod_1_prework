## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
- My workflow went much much smoother.  I already incorporated short breaks into my work schedule before but never with structure.  The structure of the breaks really helps.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
-  I was actually surprised with how easy it was to conform to the technique.  I did seem more focused than before.  This is definitely a technique that is beneficial to me individually.  I did actually estimate well.

1. In your own words, what is a Class?
- A class is kind of like a broad definition of a type of thing or a category.  Objects are housed inside classes and they are a good way to store relvant information for multiple objects.

1. What is an attribute of a Class?
- These are descriptions that all objects of the class share. Height age etc...
1. What is behavior of a Class?
- A behavior of a class is a method which all objects associated with the class can use.

1. In the space below, create a Dog class with at least 2 attributes and 2 behaviors:

```rb
class MyDog
  attr_reader :color :age

  def initialize(color, age)
    @color = color
    @age = age
  end

  def speak
    puts "BARK!"
  end

  def play
    puts "Is playing"
  end
end




```

1. How do you create an instance of a class?
- An instance of a class is created when you create an object associated with the class
1. What questions do you still have about classes in Ruby?
- I would just like more practice.  I feel like I get better at understanding it everytime.
